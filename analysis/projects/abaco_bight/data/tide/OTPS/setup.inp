1. Tidal model control file (ASCII, supplied with the model, starting
   from "Model_") contains AT LEAST 3 lines:

   elevation model file name
   transport model file name
   bathymetry grid file name
   {name of function to convert x,y to lon,lat}

   Please show FULL path to the model files in the "Model_*" file
   unless they are located in /DATA (download default).

   4th line in Model_* file is used ONLY for models calculated on
   uniform grid in km. Converting functions are provided with
   current version of OTPS. Try downloading latest OTPS, if the 
   converting function is missing in your version.

2. latitude, longitude and time file is an ASCII file, consisting
   either of 2 OR 8 columns:
   latitude (degrees) longitude (degrees) [yyyy mm dd hh mm ss]
   Common sign convention:
   lat>0 - degrees North, lon>0 - degrees East
   lat<0 - degrees South, lon<0 - degrees West
   [yyyy mm dd hh mm ss] - year month day hour seconds
   These 6 columns are needed for tide predictions only.
   You may leave them empty if only extracting HC

3. Extract HC/predict tide for:
   z/U/V/u/v - elevation(m) /WE transport(m^2/s)/ SN transport(m^2/s)/
                             WE velocity (cm/s) / SN velocity (cm/s)

4. Constituent names should be in LOWER case and separated by comma.
   Leave the line blank, if ALL model constituents are included

5. AP/RI - output amplitude and phase(GMT) OR real/imaginary parts.
           Only used when extracting HC.
           May leave blank, if predicting tide.

6. Only needed for tide prediction. 1/0 - Do/Not correct for the minor
   constituents. Only works if 8 major constituents: m2,s2,n2,k2,k1,o1,p1,q1
   are included in line 4 (or line 4 left blank).

7. oce/geo - extract ocean/geocentric HC for elevations only.
            Geocentric tide is appropriate for comparison to or
            correction of altimetry data.
            May leave blank if not z on line 3.
